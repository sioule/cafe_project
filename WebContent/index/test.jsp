<div>You Won't 'Fall out of Love' with These Phrases
Valentine's Day brings a lot of talk about falling in love. But how do you talk about falling out of love? Here are some words and phrases to describe the end of a relationship.

The sad feeling you have when a relationship ends is "heartbreak." And you can say that you "broke someone's heart" if you end a relationship and make them sad.

A "heartbreaker" is someone who breaks a lot of hearts, usually because they are very attractive but not very good at thinking about other people's feelings.

If a couple decides their relationship needs to end, they "break up" or "split up." A less nice way to say you have broken up with someone is to say you "dumped" them — as if you threw them away like garbage.

After breaking up with someone, you can add "ex" onto the title of the relationship you used to have with them — so a "boyfriend" would become an "ex-boyfriend." It's also common to just call a former partner an "ex."

Breaking up usually isn't very nice, but some would say that "unrequited love" is worse. This is when you love someone but they don't love you back.

What if you thought someone liked you, but then they suddenly stopped seeing or talking to you without explaining why? In modern slang, this is called "ghosting," because it's as if the person has disappeared like a ghost.

Thankfully, heartbreak doesn't last forever. After some time, people "get over" their ex and begin to feel happier. And when a person is ready to start a new relationship, we say that they have "moved on" from their old one.
